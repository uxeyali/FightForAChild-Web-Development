    <span style="strong"><b>ACUTE MALNUTRITION </b></span> <br>
    Routine nourishment allows humans to secure the energy their bodies need to support vital organ functions, cell development, and tissue maintenance. Acute malnutrition occurs when the body doesn’t receive this nourishment and exhausts its energy reserves: the body begins to consume its own tissues in search of the nutrients and energy it needs to survive, targeting muscle and body fat first. The body’s metabolism begins to slow, thermal regulation is disrupted, kidney function is impaired, and the immune system’s capacity is diminished. The greater the loss of muscle and other tissue, the less likely the chances of survival. </p>

    <p class="para"><span style="strong"><b>MODERATE ACUTE MALNUTRITION</b></span><br>
        Moderate acute malnutrition greatly increasing morbidity rates—an individual’s risk of death—by introducing serious deficiencies that compromise a person’s immune system, leaving them more susceptible to illness and disease. These deficiencies include anemia (from a lack of iron), goiter (from a lack of iodine), and xerophthalmia (from a lack of vitamin A), as well as scurvy, pellagra, beriberi (from a lack of vitamin B), and rickets (from a lack of vitamin D).</p>

    <p class="para"><span style="strong"><b>SEVERE ACUTE MALNUTRITION</b></span><br>
    Acute malnutrition’s most extreme form—a deadly condition if left untreated—severe acute malnutrition afflicts an estimated 17 million children worldwide, and results in the loss of 1 million children under five every year. This loss of life is all the more tragic because severe acute malnutrition is predictable, preventable, and treatable. </p>
