              Hello, I made this website and it was a pain in my rear! I do love making websites though. I created a lot of new things and learnt to do some interesting things.Most importantly I learnt how to combine javascript, css, html, php etc. and using them to do things that I wanted them to do.</p>
              
              <p>
              A lot of the time that I spent doing this was spent cursing at my computer because I didn't think there was enough time to finish this. Fortunately I did.</p>
