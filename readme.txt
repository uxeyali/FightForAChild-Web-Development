I created this website as a Capstone project. We were free to choose the topic and so I chose one that meant something to me. I created this website on the many ways children were abused and to spread awareness.

I was learning how to use Php and Javascript when I was creating this so my focus was mostly on creating a beautiful website that could actually be functional and someday be deployed.


Specific instructions:
        -Select the topics you want to learn about and click "Learn".
        -To open the sidebar navigation, click the hamburger icon.
        
Outline:
        - The index.php file allows you to select that you want to learn about. So you can just select the topics you want (which are checkboxes in reality) and click "Learn".
        -There is a link that takes you to the Donation page which has a pretty cool form. All information is appended to a txt file for later use.
        -There is also a email input in the footer which takes email and appends it to the file.
